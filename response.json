As soon as I received the necessary paperwork, I began making payments to Truist Bank online. All mortgage payments have been on time. \n\nYesterday I received a notice saying that because Truist was not not able to predict the amount of money needed to cover insurance and taxes they would increase my monthly escrow by {$43.00}. If they had looked they would see that both insurance and taxes were paid last XXXX, and my mortgage had been adjusted down because I had been paying too much into escrow. \n\nI seriously doubt that either insurance or taxes will go up by anywhere near this amount. While stating that my mortgage payment would remain the same, they get around raising the monthly mortgage payment by increasing the escrow. \n\nI do not believe there is any real need for this increase. If interest rates had not gone up so much since I took out this mortgage I would look for a mortgage with another institution. But since rates have gone up so much there's no way I can refinance without paying a lot more in interest.",
